## Chapter 2 - Seventeen Years

EDD - Employment Development Department
Carl - The upper middle manager at the EDD
DPT - Daily Production Tally
IRS - Internal Revenue Service
DOL - Department of Labor

Carl's stuff was planning for a training session for new hires over Zoom. But because the system is not GUI friendly, it was not easy to tell about macros (keyboard shortcuts.)

While Carl was watching the meeting, he received about a thousand emails in an hour. Those are from 400 new hires Carl was assigned. They didn't have permissions in the system to process items, nor return items to the queue. They needed Carl to reassign items.

The training manual is 800 pages long, and the guy who call himself "The new guy" has been working for 17 years - 17 years to work independently.

> an employee who kept calling himself "the new guy." Finally, she asked him how long he'd worked at the EDD. "Seventeen years," he replied. What he meant was that, compared with his colleagues with over twenty-five years of experience, he was still getting up to speed on how the system worked.

All flagged items go to the "recomp" pile - where the most experienced processors work through by hand. -> Bottleneck!

To work in recomp, you need to have many years of experience and education.

New hires for supporting the pandemic situation were not able to be helpful. But the department hired over 5000 new hires since the beginning of COVID.

New hires can't help. Experienced processors are training the new hires. Who can actually proceed?

The productivity went worse - 2-5 times slower. The policy and processes of Unemployment Insurance takes 17 years to learn.

> The tech gets complex because the program and the policy governing it are complex. And like the tech, the policy is complex in part because it always accrues but is rarely reduced or reconciled. Like a hoarder, government rarely throws out the old to make room for the new.

IRS modernization - 73,000 pages long regulations and statuses to implement into the system. Between 2001 and 2012, the tax code changed 4680 times(!)

> The problems lie in federal policies, not legacy computer systems.

Federal policies cascade to state policies. There are 50 (and 3) states - 53 systems get the impact.

One of the Unemployment Insurance eligibilities:

- You are able and available to work
  - You cannot receive if you get a sick for a day - BUT, you'd be eligible to "disability insurance"

Lawmakers do not want give both benefits.

Now, the pandemic hit. Government is ready to distribute Unemployment Insurance - but what if you are sick? Are you eligible? If you are sick but if the system automatically determines you are not, the system will make you a lier. Your disability insurance can be suspended... Multiple policy layers.

Not all forms are digitalized. PDF/Paper forms are available. We cannot update them immediately.

> But updating the paper version of the certification form was another matter. The EDD could issue a new form, but the old one was around at all sorts of advocary and support agencies, some of whom would likely miss the changeover. It was also all over the web as a PDF.

Yet another problem - translation. To provide a translation service, they needed a permission.

> If you really wanted non-English speakers to be able to use the service in their native language, you'd give the department time to conduct a plain-language review in English first.

Because the policies are written in unclear terminology. It's difficult to understand even in English.

The low expectation to the system.

> The federal DOL sets the goal for timeliness of payments at 87 percent, meaning that state labor agencies get a good grade even if one in every eight workers who apply has to wait over three weeks to receive a first payment.

Between 2000 and 2019, 22 state claimed to have their system modernized. But when the pandemic hit, those states did not get highlighted - modernization didn't work!

> The problem is that the modernization projects all sought to "add functionality" - more layers of paint - or just to move to more modern infrastructure, particularly to the cloud. None of them targeted serving clients better or scaling to meet demand.

And they cost!

> And more of what policymakers do to ensure program integrity ends up costing far more in administration than the program saves on paying out benefits.

This is not only a particular department!

> This one had been in development for twelve years, and it was about to be released to vendor to bid with a $600 million price tag. When I told her I thought it would likely fail, she replied, "Do you think we don't know that? The last seven IT projects in this state have all failed."

Modernizing is not removing the mainframes and COBOL.

> But today, I'd bet on a legachy mainframe with a thirty-page manual over a modern system that takes decades to learn. If we want services that scale to meet people's needs, it's not just a matter of building new technology. It's a matter of clearing out the clutter it rests upon.

-> The policies.
