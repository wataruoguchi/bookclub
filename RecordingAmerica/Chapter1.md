EDD - Employment Development Department

Applicants were calling the EDD, but only a tiny fraction of the calls were being answered (1/1000!)

Even if it was answered, it was by newly hired staffers with no training.

Additionally, they found out the EDD had limited each office to escalating just a few cases a week (!!!)

> What most people don't appreciate, though, is just how difficult it can be to make computers do something as simple as counting the number of applications when there isn't one system in question but many and those systems have accrued in layers over the decades.

Tech investments must always be pitched as adding features, not renovating. -> It becomes complex and fragile.

> It becomes harder and harder to support the technologies in the lower, older layers, while the more recent layers require constant updates and patches. The paint cracks.

The oldest layer is running on an IBM mainframe. Some layers are written in COBOL... It is operated with green-screen emulators. AND some started writing scripts (macros) to automate routines on top of that. Now you need people who know multiple programming languages AND all these particular macro operates.

> The only place someone can learn that is by working at the EDD. And given how chaotically this layer of technology developed over several decades - with new macros written every time the department needed to implement a new workflow or respond to some change in the rules or regulations - it can take many years on the job to get up to speed.

Over the decades, there are so many new systems have been built. The users of those invented different approaches and different workaround - not knowing that cause inconsistent.

- "Stop Payment Alert - Claim Review" - 730k, no critical claims. Ignored.
- "Stop Payment Alert" - Super critical, but also ignored.

Just to count how many backlogged unemployment applications, humans needed to look not just at one system but many. And needed specialized knowledge of the meaning of queues to know "What is backlogged".

> California's EDD was theoretically just weeks away from awarding a modernization contract that it had been working on for ten years. With the EDD in the spotlight, the legislature paid particular attention to this pending contract and noted, with horror, that the modernization eddort was projected to take another eleven years.

It takes years to learn the business logic and programs. And the features have built on top of that.

One of the ex-Google SDE lead the project for counting the number of backlogged unemployment applications at the EDD. They forecasted "one week", but it took seven weeks (!)

> The final number was not 239,000, plus whatever other applications had become backlogged during those seven weeks. It was 1.2 million.

1.2 mil / 238k -> 5 times more!
