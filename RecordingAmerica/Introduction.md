# RECORDING AMERICA

## Introduction: Beyond _Schoolhouse Rock!_

### Topic 1 - When California legalized marijuana use

- Many people who have a felony cannot find a job.
- It generated a big industry.
- The marijuana gold rush opportunity was limited to:
   - People who never used weed, or
   - People who'd never been caught.

> Whites and people of color use marijuana at approximately the same rates, but people of color went to jail for it nearly four times more often

Removing criminal history is hard.

- Too many entities such as the arresting agency (local, state, or federal police), jail and prison files, prosecutors' records, probation records, and all the relevant materials in all the applicable jurisdictions are involved.
- Hence, hardly anyone tried to start the process.


### Topic 2 - Medicare

In 1965 - 48% of the elderly lacked health coverage. Today, it's just 2%.

In 2015 - a major overhaul of Medicare. But this does not get supported byt many stakeholders.

> The only thing he hated more than the current system was the thought of having to learn a new one.

It was predicted to cause an exodus from Medicare within their ranks. 

### Topic 3 - COVID-19, EI (Employment Insurance), Special Assistance

Congress pushed this, but the progress was slow. Even thought the system existed. Many states noticed their system for administering UI needs immedicate modernization.

> But twenty-two states had already "modernized" - meaning they had moved from decades-old mainframe computers to the cloud - and they fared no better.

> For once, thanks to an extraordinary crisis, Democrats and Republicans had (mostly) come together and acted with speed and resolve. But their best intentions were being dashed on the ugly rocks of implemntation.

### Topic 4 - Code for America

Code for America was founded. City and county governments partnered with Code for America to improve the quality of their technology and design.

In 2013 - `healthcare.gov` was launched, but the site immediately crashed :/

- ["Schoolhouse Rock!" on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OgVKvqTItto)

The 115th US Congress enacted 344 pieces of legislation -> Add to the output of 50 states and 35,000+ local governments and more work. Someone in each org needs to figure out how to implement and enforce it (!)

Every time, the system may need to be updated.

> the essence of the digital revolution is that it has become easier to implement ideas of all kinds - business, cultural, and social.
> Inside government, however, the digital revolution has played out very differently. Even as our expectations about the immediacy and accuracy of services have skyrocketed, the implementation of laws has become anything but easier. The famous slowness of bureaucracy is a key reason, but all too frequently, what now widens the gap between policy intentions and actual outcomes is the messy task of implementation through digital technology, and the ways government makes working with that technology uniquely complex.

"Government needs to spend more on technology" people say.

Government does not know if the estimation the private sectors provided is reasonable and appropriate. They need to pay blindly. And private sectors draw $$$ from government.

**Personal note: e.g., Fujitsu.**

> When all your time is spent answering questions and writing reports for other people inside government, it's mighty hard to be focused on the people outside government you're supposed to serve.
> Spending more ono blockbuster projects, pursuing the latest technologies, outsourcing more aggressively, and ramping up oversight doesn't help. But it's worse than that. These supposed solutions hurt, making it even harder to deliver on policy promises.

Tech vendors are supposed to look at the end users (residents, citizens) but the project is managed by government.

"Game of Telephone"

> The systems are designed instead to meet the needs of the bureaucracies that create them - they are risk-mitigation strategies for dozens of internal stakeholders.

Policymakers are not necessarily the user.
